Product Requirements Document (PRD)\r\n\r\n**Product Name:** AI-Integrated Community Portal  \r\n**Goal:** A unified hub combining community discussions (Discourse), knowledge base/docs (Starlight), and AI-powered content discovery, with integrated authentication and selective gating for premium/educational content.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\nCurrent communities either have:\r\n- Great discussions but poor structured knowledge (e.g., Discord, Discourse-only).\r\n- Great documentation but no live community engagement (e.g., Starlight-only).\r\n\r\nThis project solves that by:\r\n- Combining both layers.\r\n- Adding **AI-based discovery** and **semantic search**.\r\n- Enabling Markdown publishing from VSCode for trusted contributors.\r\n- Providing authentication and premium gating for monetization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Objectives\r\n- Seamless integration of **Discourse** + **Starlight** + AI linking.\r\n- Unified login and content pipeline.\r\n- AI to surface related content and power semantic search.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Target Users\r\n- **Community Builders**\r\n- **Learners & Execs**\r\n- **Contributors (Docs/Markdown)**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n#### MVP\r\n1. **Knowledge Layer**\r\n   - Starlight site deployed.\r\n   - Markdown-based publishing with GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n2. **Authentication & Access Control**\r\n   - Supabase for auth (email, OAuth).\r\n   - Single login for Starlight + Discourse.\r\n   - Gate content from Knowledge layer with Supabase RLS.\r\n\r\n3. **Community Layer**\r\n   - Discourse.org instance with categories and tagging.\r\n   - API enabled for integration.\r\n\r\n4. **AI Integration (Phase 1)**\r\n   - Semantic search across Starlight + Discourse.\r\n   - Suggest related content links.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 🚀 Next Steps (Advanced Features)\r\n1. Push-to-Starlight from VSCode.\r\n2. AI summarization for long threads.\r\n3. Personalized recommendation engine.\r\n4. Premium content (Stripe integration).\r\n5. Analytics dashboard.\r\n6. AI Guide (voice/multimodal) for answering questions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Solution Architecture (SA)\r\n\r\n### Core Components\r\n- **Frontend:** Starlight (docs), Discourse.org UI.\r\n- **Backend:** Supabase for auth + DB, Discourse (Postgres).\r\n- **Integration:** Discourse API → Starlight build pipeline.\r\n- **AI Layer:** Llama 3.2+ pgvector for embeddings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Workflow\r\n1. User logs in → Supabase token shared across Discourse + Starlight.\r\n2. New Discourse topic → AI extracts metadata → Updates vector DB.\r\n3. New Starlight doc → AI indexes → Suggests related threads.\r\n4. Semantic search via unified API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Tech Stack\r\n- **Auth:** Supabase.\r\n- **Hosting:** Vercel (Starlight), DigitalOcean/AWS (Discourse).\r\n- **AI:** OpenAI API, pgvector or LanceDB.\r\n- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for doc builds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Authentication: Supabase vs Clerk\r\n- Supabase = DB + Auth in one, cost-effective, full control.\r\n- Clerk = great UX but higher cost.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** Supabase.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Data Flow\r\n- User → Supabase Auth → Unified token.\r\n- Discourse & Starlight linked via API and AI layer.\r\n- Vector DB stores embeddings for semantic search.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## MVP\r\n- Starlight site live (basic docs).\r\n\r\n## Phase 1\r\n- Supabase auth for gated pages.\r\n\r\n## Phase 2\r\n- Discourse instance deployed.\r\n\r\n## Phase 3\r\n- AI semantic search prototype.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n\r\n### Use Case 1: Paid Online Course Participation\r\n\r\n**User Type:** Course Participants (Paid
